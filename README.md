mod {
    web_layout {
        PageTypes {
            // Default Page
            1 {
                config {
                    1 {
                        label = General
                        fields = title, subtitle
                        previewFields = title
                    }
                    2 {
                        label = Special
                        fields = slug, suergroup, hidden
                        previewFields = *
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

* In mod.web_layout.PageTypes use the ID of a page type to start configuration, e.g. '1' for default pages
* Inside the 'config' you can define the required button groups
  ** You need to define a 'label' to display in the backend
  ** With fields you can define one or multiple fields to edit with this button (e.g: fields=title,subtitle)
  ** The property 'previewFields' defines which fields should be previewed in the backend.
  ** If the 'previewFields' should be the same as the defined 'fields' you can use the '*'
